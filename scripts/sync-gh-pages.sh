# sync-gh-pages.sh — build main and deploy the fresh dist/ to the gh-pages branch.
#
# Rule: main and gh-pages MUST stay in sync. gh-pages is a snapshot of the latest
# main build, not a separate working branch. Never commit source to gh-pages,
# never commit built artefacts to main. This script enforces that contract.
#
# Usage:  ./scripts/sync-gh-pages.sh
# Effect: runs `gen` -> `build` -> chains a single deploy commit onto the current
#         gh-pages tip (no clone) and pushes it. Git dedupes unchanged files, so
#         only what changed is uploaded (~MBs), not the 170 MB site.
#         Always run from the repo root on the main branch.

# 5. Fetch the CURRENT gh-pages ref (commits+trees only — no blobs). We only

#    into a commit whose parent is the current gh-pages tip.
#
#    Because the parent commit already contains the unchanged video/image
#    blobs, `git push` uploads ONLY the files that actually changed (~MBs),
#    not the 170 MB site. The previous approach cloned the branch fresh on
#    every deploy — after 26 snapshot commits that clone (and its bandwidth)
#    grew until deploys stalled entirely.
